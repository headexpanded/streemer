## About Streemer

Streemer takes the pain out of paying for energy.

Large lump-sum energy payments are a problem. Streemer helps you take control over when, how often, and how much you pay for your energy consumption.

-   Register as a user on the site
-   Connect your smart meter, and select your energy supplier.
-   Set your payment limit, and your payment method.

When your energy cost reaches your payment limit, that amount is paid to your energy supplier, automatically.

## Example

I connect my smart meter. I set my payment limit at 20 dollars. When I have used 20 dollars of energy, 20 dollars is paid from my account direct to my energy supplier.

-   I can add smart meters, or remove smart meters, at any time.
-   I can change my payment _limit_ at any time.
-   I can change my payment _method_ at any time.
-   I can _pause_ Streemer at any time.
-   At the end of my billing period, the remaining payable is far less than before!
